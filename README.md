# musicology_portfolio
Portfolio repository for the subject Computational Musicology

This portfolio aims to analyze a specific branch of hip-hop, namely industrial hip-hop. Industrial hip-hop, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting and bizarre genres in rap music. Being a fusion of industrial music and hip-hop, the genre showcases artists blending harsh, mechanical, transgressive or provocative sounds accompanied with rap and rhythm. Due to it being a niche genre, one which many people may not be familiar with, I believe it would be a very interesting topic to explore in this online portfolio. The goal of this portfolio is to research how Spotify interprets and understands industrial hip-hop by analyzing features and songs in the genre to see how this branch differs from other Hip-Hop genres.

My corpus consists of my own playlist titled “Industrial hip-hop”, which contains 40 songs of the genre. The playlist contains many songs in the genre, particularly from artists such as JPEGMAFIA, clipping and Death Grips, as these three are among the most well-known artists in the Industrial Hip-Hop genre.
